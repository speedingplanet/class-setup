# React configuration

Additional configuration for classes which cover or use React

- Definitely use the [React Dev Tools](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/react-developer-tools), also mentioned at the beta docs
- If the class is going to use Redux, you should install the [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) appropriate to your browser
- Visual Studio Code setup
  - The React Beta Docs have a great [setup](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/editor-setup) doc for Visual Studio Code. 
  - As an extension, you should install [ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) Terrible name, good snippets. Be careful of imitation/fake/duplicate versions
