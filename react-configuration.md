# React configuration

Additional configuration for classes which cover or use React

## Browser

- Definitely use the [React Dev Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools), mentioned above in the React docs. We will definitely be using this in class. This is a browser extension, available for most browsers.
- If the class is going to use Redux, you should install the [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) appropriate to your browser. We will also be using this in class. 


## Visual Studio Code 

- The React Dev Docs have a great [setup](https://react.dev/learn/editor-setup) doc for Visual Studio Code. 
  - In particular, class files will use the React ESLint configuration, which goes a long way to suggesting good React code practices. 
- [Simple React Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=burkeholland.simple-react-snippets) Good, simple list of React snippets.
