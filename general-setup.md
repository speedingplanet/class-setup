# General setup for JavaScript classes

## Software

### Required

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): the engine for most JavaScript classes. You should download either the LTS (v12.x at the moment) or the Current (v14.x) version. Class usually supports LTS - 1 (v10.x in this case).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Source control management, also used by many tools
- A web browser, can be any of
  - Firefox
  - Chrome
  - [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
  - Other browsers (Internet Explorer, Safari, Brave, Opera, etc. may work in class but are not officially supported)
- An editor
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is strongly preferred, but others are available
    - Check out some [recommended extensions](vs-code-extensions.md) for VS Code.
  - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or IntelliJ, also by JetBrains
  - [Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
  - SublimeText, Emacs, Vi(m) if you like configuring your editor yourself
  - Notepad++, Atom, TextMate, etc. if you can't install any of the above
  - Eclipse is not a viable choice. JavaScript support on Eclipse is a disaster.
- Class source code. You should have received a link to the class source code. You can always try the [Speeding Planet repository](https://github.com/speedingplanet) to see if it's there.

### Optional

These will make your development experience better.

#### Windows

- Command prompt: [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) or [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)

#### MacOS

- Terminal: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) or [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
- Shell: [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) or [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), though bash is fine

### Class-specific setups

TBD
