# General setup for JavaScript classes

Courses can be conducted on Windows 8 or later, MacOS X Mojave (10.18) or later, and Linux (most modern versions). We recommend running
any course on a computer with a modern processor, 8GB+ of RAM and at least 250GB of disk space. 

Courses are intended to be run on a computer with Administrative access, at least at the point of install of the software below. 

Courses is not intended to run on a tablet, such as an Apple iPad or a Windows Surface or similar. 

## Required Software

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): the engine for most JavaScript classes. You should download either the LTS (v14.x at the moment) or the Current (v15.x) version. Class usually supports LTS - 1 (v12.x in this case).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Source control management, also used by many tools
- A web browser, can be any of
  - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/)
  - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)
  - Other browsers (Internet Explorer, Safari, Brave, Opera, etc. may work in class but are not officially supported)
- An editor
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is strongly preferred, but others are available
    - Check out some [recommended extensions](vs-code-extensions.md) for VS Code.
  - [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) or [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), also by JetBrains
  - SublimeText, Emacs, Vi(m): if you like configuring your editor yourself
  - Notepad++, Atom, TextMate, etc.: if you can't install any of the above
  - Eclipse is not a viable choice. JavaScript support on Eclipse is a disaster.
  - Notepad is not a viable choice. It does not have enough features for you to be a productive developer
- Class source code. A GitHub repository for the class source code will be set up in time for class. It will include demos, labs, and other materials as appropriate. 

## Optional Software

These will make your development experience better.

### Windows

- Command prompt: [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) or [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)

### MacOS

- Terminal: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) or [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
- Shell: [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) or [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/), though bash is fine
